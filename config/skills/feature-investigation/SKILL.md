# Feature Investigation - AC-Driven Implementation Planning

Investigate and plan the implementation of a new feature with **Acceptance Criteria as the central organizing principle**. Every task, test, and verification ties back to specific AC.

**Feature Request:** $ARGUMENTS (JIRA issue key or feature description)

## Philosophy: AC-First Development

**Why features fail:** Acceptance criteria get buried in documentation, forgotten during implementation, and only remembered during QA when it's expensive to fix.

**This skill ensures:**

1. AC are validated and clarified BEFORE any planning
2. Every task links to specific AC
3. Checkpoints verify AC progress throughout development
4. PR checklist explicitly maps to AC

## Investigation Process:

### 0. **Check for Previous Feature Planning**

```bash
REPORT_BASE="${REPORT_BASE:-$HOME/Documents/technical-analysis}"
FEATURE_ID="$ARGUMENTS"
FEATURE_DIR="${REPORT_BASE}/features/${FEATURE_ID}"
PLAN_FILE="${FEATURE_DIR}/implementation-plan.md"
DESIGN_FILE="${FEATURE_DIR}/technical-design.md"
TASKS_FILE="${FEATURE_DIR}/task-breakdown.md"

if [[ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "🔍 Found previous planning for $FEATURE_ID"
    echo "📁 Location: $FEATURE_DIR"

    sed -n '/## Executive Summary/,/## Feature Details/p' "$PLAN_FILE" | head -20
    sed -n '/## Implementation Approach/,/## Technical Design/p' "$PLAN_FILE" | head -20

    LAST_MODIFIED=$(stat -f "%Sm" -t "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" "$PLAN_FILE" 2>/dev/null || \
                    date -r "$PLAN_FILE" "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" 2>/dev/null || echo "Unknown")
    echo "📅 Last Planning Session: $LAST_MODIFIED"

    grep -A 20 "### Sprint Planning" "$PLAN_FILE" | grep "^- \[ \]" | head -5 || true

    echo ""
    echo "Continue refining existing plan (A) or start fresh (B)?"
else
    echo "🆕 No previous planning found for $FEATURE_ID"
    echo "📁 Will create new planning at: $FEATURE_DIR"
fi
```

### 1. **Fetch Feature Details from JIRA**

```bash
if [[ "$FEATURE_ID" =~ ^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    jira issue view "$FEATURE_ID" --raw > /tmp/feature_details.json

    SUMMARY=$(jq -r '.fields.summary' /tmp/feature_details.json)
    DESCRIPTION=$(jq -r '.fields.description' /tmp/feature_details.json)
    REPORTER=$(jq -r '.fields.reporter.displayName' /tmp/feature_details.json)
    PRIORITY=$(jq -r '.fields.priority.name' /tmp/feature_details.json)
    STATUS=$(jq -r '.fields.status.name' /tmp/feature_details.json)
    COMPONENTS=$(jq -r '.fields.components[].name' /tmp/feature_details.json 2>/dev/null || echo "None")
    ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA=$(jq -r '.fields.customfield_10100' /tmp/feature_details.json 2>/dev/null || echo "To be defined")

    jira issue comment list "$FEATURE_ID" --raw > /tmp/feature_comments.json

    echo "✅ Feature: $SUMMARY"
    echo "   Priority: $PRIORITY | Status: $STATUS"
else
    echo "📝 Feature description provided directly (not a JIRA ticket)"
    SUMMARY="$FEATURE_ID"
fi
```

### 1.1 **Analyze Video Attachments from JIRA**

If the JIRA ticket contains video attachments, treat them as required ticket source material. Clear written AC do not waive this step. Seeing attachment metadata is not analysis.

#### Video analysis hard gate

- Immediately after fetching `/tmp/feature_details.json`, MUST inspect `.fields.attachment[]` for both:
  - MIME types starting with `video/`
  - common video filename extensions: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.m4v`
- If any video exists, MUST create and maintain `VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS` with one entry per video, each marked exactly one of: `analyzed` or `inaccessible`.
- `VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS` MUST have no implicit skip state. If `N != A + I`, STOP.
- MUST download each video when possible using the authenticated Jira attachment URL from the raw JSON.
- If a download fails, MUST create an inaccessible artifact for that video with the attachment URL, filename, tool or command attempted, and the exact error returned.
- MUST produce deterministic analysis artifacts before AC validation or planning.
- MUST reconcile video findings with the written description, comments, and AC.
- If video contradicts the written ticket, MUST call out the conflict explicitly and STOP for clarification before implementation planning.

#### Required checklist actions

```bash
ATTACHMENTS_DIR="${FEATURE_DIR}/attachments"
VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR="${FEATURE_DIR}/video-analysis"
VIDEO_STATUS_FILE="${VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR}/VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS.md"
mkdir -p "$ATTACHMENTS_DIR" "$VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR"

# Detect videos from the raw Jira JSON immediately after fetch.
jq -r '
  (.fields.attachment // [])
  | map(select(
      ((.mimeType // "") | startswith("video/")) or
      ((.filename // "") | test("\\.(mp4|mov|webm|mkv|avi|m4v)$"; "i"))
    ))
  | .[]
  | [.filename, .mimeType, .content] | @tsv
' /tmp/feature_details.json > /tmp/jira_video_attachments.tsv

# Maintain an explicit status list. Every detected video MUST appear exactly once.
cat > "$VIDEO_STATUS_FILE" <<'EOF'
# VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS
# Status MUST be exactly one of: analyzed | inaccessible
EOF
```

For each detected video, MUST perform all applicable actions in order:

1. Download it from the Jira attachment URL in `/tmp/feature_details.json` into `${FEATURE_DIR}/attachments/`.
2. If download succeeds, generate deterministic artifacts under `${FEATURE_DIR}/video-analysis/`:
   - metadata and duration when available;
   - representative frames when tooling exists;
   - a timestamped analysis artifact with observations, inferred requirements, conflicts with the written ticket, and open questions.
3. Mark that video `analyzed` in `VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS`.
4. If download or analysis tooling fails, create `${VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR}/${VIDEO_BASENAME}.inaccessible.md` containing:
   - attachment filename;
   - Jira attachment URL;
   - command or tool attempted;
   - exact error;
   - whether metadata or frames were unavailable.
5. Mark that video `inaccessible` in `VIDEO_ANALYSIS_STATUS`.

Representative frame extraction remains RECOMMENDED when tooling exists:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "$VIDEO_FILE" -vf fps=1 "${VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR}/${VIDEO_BASENAME}-frame-%04d.png"
```

#### Required analysis artifact

Create `${VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR}/${VIDEO_BASENAME}.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Video Analysis: [VIDEO_FILENAME]

## Source

- Jira attachment: [filename]
- Jira attachment URL: [URL]
- Local file: [path]
- Duration: [duration if available]

## Metadata

- [Codec, dimensions, duration, or "Unavailable"]

## Representative Frames

- [Timestamp or frame file] [Why it matters]

## Observed User Flow

1. [Timestamp] [Action the user takes]
2. [Timestamp] [Result visible in the UI]

## Visible UI States and Data

- [Timestamp] [Fields, values, labels, validation messages, loading/empty/error states]

## OCR / On-Screen Text

- [Timestamp] [Text visible in the recording]

## Requirements Inferred from Video

- [Potential requirement or edge case inferred from the recording]

## Conflicts with Written Ticket

- [Conflict, or "None found"]

## Open Questions

- [Question, or "None"]
```

#### Common failure to avoid

Attachment metadata alone is not analysis. A filename, MIME type, and URL without download outcome plus analysis or inaccessible artifact is a failed gate.

### 1.5 **GATE: Acceptance Criteria Validation** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**STOP HERE if AC are missing or unclear. STOP HERE if video attachments were found but not fully accounted for. Do not proceed to planning.**

- Use this exact self-check line before AC validation: `Before proceeding, state: Video attachments found: N; analyzed: A; inaccessible: I; artifacts: ...`. If `N != A + I`, STOP.

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "         ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA REVIEW         "
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════"

VIDEO_ATTACHMENTS_FOUND=$(awk 'END { print NR }' /tmp/jira_video_attachments.tsv 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
VIDEO_ANALYZED_COUNT=$(grep -c ': analyzed$' "$VIDEO_STATUS_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
VIDEO_INACCESSIBLE_COUNT=$(grep -c ': inaccessible$' "$VIDEO_STATUS_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

echo "Before proceeding, state: Video attachments found: ${VIDEO_ATTACHMENTS_FOUND}; analyzed: ${VIDEO_ANALYZED_COUNT}; inaccessible: ${VIDEO_INACCESSIBLE_COUNT}; artifacts: ${VIDEO_ANALYSIS_DIR}"

if [[ "$VIDEO_ATTACHMENTS_FOUND" -ne $((VIDEO_ANALYZED_COUNT + VIDEO_INACCESSIBLE_COUNT)) ]]; then
    echo "STOP: video attachments were not fully analyzed or marked inaccessible."
    exit 1
fi

if [[ -n "$ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA" ]] && [[ "$ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA" != "null" ]] && \
   [[ "$ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA" != "To be defined" ]]; then
    echo "📋 Acceptance Criteria from JIRA:"
    echo "$ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA"
else
    echo "⚠️  NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOUND IN JIRA"
    echo "Before proceeding, AC must be defined. Ask the product owner or define them now."
fi
```

#### AC Quality Checklist

Evaluate each AC against these criteria:

| Quality Check                                      | Pass? | Issue |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Specific** — Is it clear what "done" looks like? |       |       |
| **Measurable** — Can we write a test for it?       |       |       |
| **Achievable** — Is it technically feasible?       |       |       |
| **Relevant** — Does it tie to user value?          |       |       |
| **Testable** — Can QA verify it?                   |       |       |

#### Missing AC to check for:

- [ ] Error handling — what happens when things fail?
- [ ] Loading states — what does the user see while waiting?
- [ ] Empty states — what if there's no data?
- [ ] Permissions — who can access this?
- [ ] Mobile/responsive — does it need to work on mobile?
- [ ] Accessibility — any a11y requirements?
- [ ] Performance — any speed requirements?
- [ ] Analytics — what events need tracking?

#### Refined AC format:

```markdown
## Refined Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- **AC-1**: [Clear, testable criterion]
  - Test: [How to verify]
  - Edge cases: [What to watch for]

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **AC-NFR-1**: [Performance/security/accessibility criterion]
  - Threshold: [Specific number if applicable]

### Out of Scope (Explicitly)

- [Thing that might be assumed but isn't included]
```

**⚠️ CHECKPOINT — Confirm before proceeding:**

1. All AC are clear and testable
2. Missing AC have been identified and added
3. Clarifying questions answered (or noted for follow-up)

### 2. **Codebase Analysis**

```bash
# Understand the existing codebase relevant to this feature
echo "📁 Analyzing project structure..."

# Check for similar existing features as implementation templates
grep -rn "similar-pattern" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Identify key files likely touched by this feature
# (based on components/labels from the ticket)
find src/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.py" | head -20

# Check recent related commits
git log --oneline --all --since="3 months ago" --grep="$FEATURE_ID" 2>/dev/null || true

# Look for related feature flags or config
grep -rn "featureFlag\|feature_flag\|FEATURE_" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

#### What to look for:

- **Similar features**: Use as implementation templates
- **Existing patterns**: API response formats, validation libraries, state management
- **Component libraries**: Design system components available to reuse
- **Reusable services**: Utilities that can be leveraged
- **API contracts**: Existing endpoint patterns to follow

### 3. **Cross-System Design Analysis**

#### Frontend Planning:

- **User Interface**: Component hierarchy and state management
- **User Experience**: Flow diagrams and interaction patterns
- **API Integration**: Required endpoints and data contracts
- **Performance**: Loading strategies and optimizations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance requirements

#### Backend Planning:

- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints or GraphQL schema
- **Data Models**: Database schema and relationships
- **Business Logic**: Service layer architecture
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Caching and query optimization

#### Integration Points:

- **API Contract**: Request/response specifications
- **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios and recovery
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side rules
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration test approach
- **Deployment**: Feature flags and rollout plan

### 4. **Implementation Phases**

# Back up previous planning if continuing
if [[ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]]; then
    BACKUP_DIR="${FEATURE_DIR}/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
    mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
    cp "$PLAN_FILE" "$BACKUP_DIR/implementation-plan.md" 2>/dev/null || true
    cp "$DESIGN_FILE" "$BACKUP_DIR/technical-design.md" 2>/dev/null || true

## Development Checkpoints

### Before Starting Any Task

- Which AC does this task address?
- What does "done" look like for this AC?
- What test will prove this AC is met?

### Before Creating a PR

- [ ] I can identify which AC this PR addresses
- [ ] I have a test for each AC in this PR
- [ ] I have manually verified each AC works
- [ ] AC status updated in `implementation-plan.md`

### Before Feature Release

- [ ] ALL AC marked ✔️ Verified
- [ ] QA has signed off on each AC
- [ ] No outstanding clarification questions
- [ ] Performance thresholds met

## Notes:

- `REPORT_BASE` defaults to `$HOME/Documents/technical-analysis`; override with env var
- Requires `jira` CLI authenticated via `jira init`
- Accepts either a JIRA ticket ID or a plain text feature description
- The AC gate (Step 1.5) is non-negotiable — vague AC = wasted development time
